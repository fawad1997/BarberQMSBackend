# Barber Dashboard Metrics Enhancement

This document explains the changes made to enhance the barber dashboard metrics functionality.

## What was fixed

1. **Upcoming Appointments Counter**
   - Previously, the "Upcoming Appointments" metric on the barber dashboard was hardcoded to 0
   - Now it displays the actual count of upcoming appointments based on the selected time period

2. **Performance Metrics Chart**
   - Enhanced the performance metrics chart to display both:
     - Number of customers served (primary metric)
     - Average service duration (secondary metric)
   - Added interactive tooltips on hover to show detailed information
   - Improved styling and legend for better readability

## Implementation Details

### Frontend Changes

1. **Dashboard UI Updates**
   - Updated the "Upcoming Appointments" card to use dynamic data from the API
   - Redesigned the performance metrics chart to display multiple metrics
   - Added tooltips and legends for improved data visualization

2. **Type Definitions**
   - Enhanced the `BarberMetrics` type to include:
     - `upcoming_appointments`: Count of upcoming appointments
     - Enhanced `DailyMetric` to include `avg_service_duration` for daily performance metrics

3. **Metrics API Middleware**
   - Updated the metrics API middleware to handle the enhanced data format
   - Added fallback mock data generation to ensure the UI works even if the backend isn't updated yet

### Backend Changes Required

To fully implement these changes, the backend API needs to be updated to include:

1. **Enhancements to `/barbers/metrics` endpoint:**
   - Add `upcoming_appointments` count to the response
   - Include `avg_service_duration` for each day in the `daily_data` array

2. **Query Logic:**
   - For `upcoming_appointments`: Count appointments that are scheduled for the future
   - For `avg_service_duration` per day: Calculate average duration of completed services per day

The file `add_metrics_functionality.py` contains sample implementation code that can be integrated into the existing backend API to support these new features.

## Testing

After implementing these changes:

1. Verify that the "Upcoming Appointments" counter changes properly when switching between time periods
2. Check that the performance metrics chart displays both customer count and service duration data
3. Confirm tooltips show the correct information when hovering over chart bars
